    <span class="text-content"><span>Mei-Ling Hopgood, associate professor and director of global initiatives at Medill, told this year’s cherubs to look for the gold flecks, or unique events in one’s experience, in order to write a compelling personal narrative. <br>
Hopgood, who was born in Taiwan, was adopted as a young girl by an American family in Michigan. She never contacted her biological parents, nor felt a desire to, but 20 years later, they reached out to her. Her memoir, “Lucky Girl,” details her return to Taiwan to connect with a family whose language and culture were foreign to her. <br>
  “Stories are the currency of our past, storyboards we arrange to make sense of the things that happen to us.” Hopgood said. <br>
  Cherubs remarked on her lessons in sharing personal truth. <br>
  “Listening to Mei-ling Hopgood's story was inspiring,” Annie Wan of China said. “I learned that people can always reconnect with their heritage and find something new.” <br>
  Hopgood is also a freelance journalist who has written for publications including National Geographic Traveler, the Miami Herald and the Boston Globe. She wrote a second book, “How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm,” in 2012.

    <span class="text-content"><span>Even life's worse moments can have a silver lining. For Ruth Ebenstein (BSJ ’90), an American-Israeli writer, peace/health activist and 1985 cherub, an unexpected friendship emerged from breast cancer. Ebenstein was diagnosed with breast cancer while living in Jerusalem and subsequently joined an Israeli-Palestinian breast cancer support group. There, she befriended Ibtisam Erekat, a Muslim Palestinian woman, whom she now calls her sister.<br>
 Speaking at the McCormick Foundation Center, Ebenstein emphasized that just as disease knows no boundaries of race, ethnicity or politics, love and friendship have no boundaries.
Through the breast cancer support group, Ebenstein said that she was blessed to meet other survivors who support each other across religious and ethnic lines. <br>
“The ‘other’ only exists in the mind, so embrace the people who seem different from you,” Ebenstein said.
Ebenstein’s story was featured on BBC World News, which focused on the support group that brought together both Palestinians and Israelis. She also wrote about her experience for The Atlantic and Tablet.<br>
“I loved hearing from Ruth because I thought her courage in the face of illness and political conflict was inspiring,” Natalie Swartz of California said. “It was very courageous of her to challenge such deep-rooted prejudice.”

    <span class="text-content"><span>Former LIFE magazine editor and reporter Dick Stolley visited cherubs for the second summer in a row, and told the story of how he covered the assassination of President John F. Kennedy for LIFE Magazine on November 22, 1963. <br> Stolley told cherubs about how he was the first reporter to see Abraham Zapruder’s film of Kennedy’s assassination. Zapruder was a civilian who caught the assassination on film by happenstance, and was the only person to have footage of it. Stolley was the first reporter to gain access to the footage and secured print rights exclusively for LIFE Magazine. <br> Stolley started his journalism career writing for his local paper when he was 15 years old. After graduating from Medill with a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1952, Stolley was a cherub instructor. A year later, he received a master’s in journalism and started reporting for LIFE Magazine. He has covered historical events, including the Montgomery Bus Boycotts in the South, and has met many important figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Kennedy. In 1974, he became the founding managing editor for People Magazine.<br>   Stolley also advised cherubs about how they should view their future careers in journalism. <br> “Tell the truth,” Stolley said. “The truth unfortunately gets mangled online a lot. The first telling ought to be the truthful telling.”</span></span>

    <span class="text-content"><span>Peter Slevin, a Medill associate professor, spoke to cherubs this summer about using his skills from journalism to write a biography. The author of “Michelle Obama: A Life,” Slevin described how his skills were put into practice as he interviewed Michelle Obama’s relatives and friends. These details went into a 432-page biography of the First Lady’s life. <br>
Slevin advised cherubs to seek sources and be persistent. He interviewed Michelle Obama during Barack Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign but did not have access to speak with her while writing the biography. <br>
“It was interesting how someone could investigate so heavily into a personality without talking to the person herself,” Matt Stockmal of Illinois said. 
Slevin told cherubs he and his family became immersed in the book. He recounted a story of his child exclaiming that it was Michelle Obama’s half birthday when asked about the significance of a particular day. <br>
  Slevin graduated from Princeton University and has a Master of Philosophy in International Relations from Oxford. He worked at the Washington Post for 12 years before he came to Northwestern. </span></span>

    <span class="text-content"><span>Roxana Saberi (MSJ ‘99), currently a senior producer for Al Jazeera America, spoke to cherubs about her work as a foreign correspondent and about her imprisonment in Iran.<br>
          When Saberi was 26, she decided to live in Iran as a freelance reporter. She covered Iranian news for U.S.-based Feature Story News. After six years living in Iran, she was charged with espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison by the Iranian government.<br>
          Her imprisonment ignited protests worldwide. After a global outcry and calls for her release from supporters in America, the Iranian government set Saberi free after 101 days.<br>
          She subsequently wrote a book titled “Between Two Worlds: My Life and Captivity in Iran” about her experiences in Evin prison.<br>
“She opened my eyes about how journalism ties in with social justice,” Jasmine Teng of Taiwan said. “I hope someday I can do what she does.”</span></span>

    <span class="text-content"><span>Kate Ward, editor-in-chief of Bustle and a 2002 cherub, told the 2015 cherubs that they should carry the lessons from the summer with them into their journalism careers. During her presentation, “10 Things All Cherubs Know to Be True,” she encouraged them to stand out and to not be afraid of making mistakes.<br>
Ward, who was wearing a T-shirt with a quote from instructor John Kupetz, said that she faced setbacks in her own career path. She said she once devoted herself to remaking Hollywood.com’s website only to have it crash during its launch. Ward said Bustle’s 2013 debut faced its own hurdles because although its primary audience is women, its founder, Bryan Goldberg, is a man. But by the close of 2014, Bustle had 20 million monthly viewers and had raised $15.5 million in a round of financing, according to Business Insider.<br>
“It was very inspirational hearing her story and her success,” Carly Price of California said. “It’s definitely a career path I see myself wanting to take. Being able to hear from such a professional was a great opportunity.”<br>
Ward added that cherub connections and friendships last well beyond the summer of the program. She said that she joined Bustle thanks to a cherub connection and that one of her bridesmaids at her wedding was a fellow cherub.

    <span class="text-content"><span>John White, who won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Photojournalism, told cherubs that photography has the power to share people’s stories because it speaks a universal language.<br>
“You realize every person out there has a heartbeat, every single person has a story,” White said. “It connects you with the heart of humanity.”
<br>White said that the values of faith, focus and flight guided his life and career. He explained that photographers should be faithful to their purpose in life, focus on the time they have in the world and take flight with their actions.
<br>“You have fresh wind for your wings because of your time here,” White said.<br>
Cherubs said they found inspiration in White’s message.<br>
 “What stood out to me the most was he kept mentioning we should all just chase our dreams,” Gabe Gross-Sable of California said.<br>
White, a former Medill instructor, was a staff photographer for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1978 until 2013. He now teaches at the Columbia College Chicago. He has won numerous accolades in addition to the Pulitzer Prize, including three National Headliner Awards, five Chicago Press Photographer Association's Photographer of the Year Awards and the Chicago Medal of Merit. White was the first inductee into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame and will be inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame in December 2015.
